To mix rest api and thymeleaf enginne

APIController(@RestController)  ==> rest API
OrderController (@Controller) ==> OrderController (JSP)


input from REST API now works. Also now we try to stick to hte input ratio as much as possible,
i.e. we only cast down to integer at the last step when calculate the ratio of the pcb orders

Next step we will try to verify with some real fit alogrithm (for exmaple nest4J)
